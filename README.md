# Homework 7: Create R package
This is the repo for homework 7 from Chenchen Guo
The aim of hw-07 is to reinforce how to create and add functions for own package.
Specifically:
  * Define and export one new function, i.e. make it available to a user upon loading the package.
  * Give function arguments sensible defaults, where relevant.
  * Document all exported functions.
  * Include at least three unit tests for your new function that test common use cases that you anticipate of the function.
  * Your package should pass check() without errors (warnings and notes are OK).
  * Update the README and vignette to show usage of all the functions in the package.
  * Modify the instructions telling someone how to install your package.
